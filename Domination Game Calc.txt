Domination Game:

Setup: Shuffle the question pile, action pile, contesting pile, and god pile separately. From the question pile, give 1 to each player then combine the remaining question cards with the action cards and reshuffle. Each player is given 3 additional cards from the combined pile. Players must answer a question card in their hand and place their home node marker on the corresponding answer node. All empty nodes connected to the home node are dominated with the players' domination marker. The 3 shuffled piles will be placed to the side for use during play.


Directions:
1. Each player will place their home node marker on a node that has the answer to one of their questions. 
	The player domintates all the connected nodes by placing domination markers on them. They will then discard that card and draw 1 from the pile
2. Play continues like this until one player controls 45/60 nodes or takes the opposing home node
3. Cards:
	-Question cards must be solved and the node with the corresponding answer can be captured, all connected free nodes are dominated
	-Free cards allow players to place a node marker on any empty node
	-Attack cards can be used during your turn to take other answer nodes, if the node is guarded it must be attacked twice to be taken
	-Guard cards can be used during your turn to protect any node from attack/conversion, this includes the player's home node. Nodes can only have one guard at a time, however if the guard breaks it can be reguarded.
4. Contested Nodes
	-In the event that you own an empty node and your opponent captures an answer node that is connected to your empty node, the empty node is converted to the color of the most recent domination unless it is guarded, in which case the guard is broken and the color remains the same
	-If a free card is used on a dominated empty node, then the player gets that node only but does not convert any nodes connected to it. This is considered an attack so guard rules apply.
	-Attacking answer nodes: Attack cards can be used during your turn to take answer nodes only if you have a connection to that answer node. To successfully attack an answer node, players must draw a contesting question from the contesting pile and solve it in the alloted time (specified on the card). Once the time is up, the player must check their answer with the answer packet for their specific question. If they are correct then the attack is successful and they dominate that node and all connected empty nodes or break any present guard. If they answer incorrectly, the attack fails. They do not get the node and any guard remains unbroken. The attack card is discarded and play continues.
	-Attacking the home node: Attacking the home node requires at least 2 connections and an attack card. When attacking the home node, players draw a question from the god card pile. These questions are significantly harder and will take more time to solve. At the end of the time, if the answer is incorrect all nodes connected to the home node are reclaimed by the defender. If the answer is correct then you win the game. All rules regarding guards are still in effect.
